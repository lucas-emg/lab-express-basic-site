        While some might say Stepan became famous because, well, all cats on the
        internet are instantly famous, some may argue that his fame come from
        his expression. You can never tell if Stepan is happy, sad, judgemental,
        empathetic or all of those together. That alone makes Stepan an
        extremely relatable character

        In 2022, russia has declared war in Ukraine, Stepan's home country.
        Since then, Stepan has used his online presence to raise awarness about
        the war and the state of Ukranian people during the war. We are all
        praying for Stepan's and all Ukranians safety and to be free from the
        war as soon as possible.
